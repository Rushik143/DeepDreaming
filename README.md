## DeepDreaming
Hello visitor, 
we are the students of KIT college of Engineering who are creating this deepdream model as part of our internship
#### What we are doing?
we want to create one deep dream learning model that will help students and learners to understan how deep dream as well as image classification works
#### What will be there in our model ?:
the model will first display the information about the image classifiacation and deep dream and also there will be option to try deep dream if you click to try deep dream it will ask on which image classification model you want to apply deep dream then it will ask to upload the image and also to select the specific layer of selected model to apply deep dream (we are interested in specific layer because the specific layer of CNN detects the specific feature from image while performing image classification). the the model will display the original image and deep dream image side by side which will be helpful for users to understanf deep dream and image classification
